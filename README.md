# 2d-simulation
This is my work for the course 2D Computer Graphics and Simulation.

The goal was to create a rendering system in JavaScript capable of translating, rotating and scaling objects.
Then, on top of that system we were tasked with implementing 2D physics and create a simulation of some kind. Instead of focusing on a single simulation, I created a flexible "scene" system which allowed me to setup a few different simulations.
